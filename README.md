# code-resources

This repository contains three React projects: a loading animation, a password show/hide button, and a GitHub user search app.

## Loading Animation

The loading animation project demonstrates how to create a simple loading animation using CSS and React. The animation is displayed while data is being fetched from an API.

## Password Show/Hide Button

The password show/hide button project demonstrates how to create an input field for a password with a button that allows the user to toggle the visibility of the password. This can improve the user experience by allowing the user to verify that they have entered the correct password.

## GitHub User Search App

The GitHub user search app project demonstrates how to create a search form that allows the user to search for GitHub users and display the results. The app uses the GitHub API to fetch data and displays the results in a list of cards, where each card shows the user's profile picture, name, and a view button.
